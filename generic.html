									<h1>About Me<br /> </h1>
									<p>Hello, my name is Hassam. At 23 years old, I have already gained valuable experience in the retail industry, having worked in it for a significant part of my life. However, my passion for data analytics has recently led me to embark on an exciting new journey. I have taken proactive steps to expand my skill set and delve into the world of data analytics.</p>
									<p>To solidify my expertise, I have earned a Google Data Analytics certification, equipping me with a strong foundation in data analysis methodologies and tools. Through this certification, I have honed my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, uncovering trends and patterns that drive business decision-making.</p>
								
									<p>In my current role as a Data Entry Specialist manager at a SMB, I have honed my skills in data analytics and expanded my technical expertise. Alongside managing data entry operations, I have acquired proficiency in CSS and HTML, enhancing my ability to navigate and contribute to web-based projects. Additionally, I have successfully implemented Python for data-scrapping tasks, leveraging its
									capabilities to streamline processes and extract valuable insights. My daily routine involves adeptly utilizing Excel to organize, and analyze data, ensuring precision and efficiency in decision-making processes. This experience has not only strengthened my managerial skills but has also positioned me as a versatile professional capable of leveraging a range of tools to drive data-driven results.</p>
									
									<p>In addition to my certification, I have dedicated myself to continuously learning and acquiring other essential skills necessary for day-to-day data analytics projects. These skills include proficiency in SQL, Tableau, and Python, allowing me to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, and visualize data, as well as automate various data processes.</p>
									
										
									<p>I am thrilled to apply my newfound knowledge and skills to real-world projects, helping organizations make data-driven decisions and achieve their goals. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for problem-solving, I am committed to leveraging data analytics to drive innovation, optimize processes, and generate actionable insights.</p>
										
									<p>As I continue to evolve in my data analytics journey, I am excited to take on new challenges, embrace emerging technologies, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of data analytics.</p>
